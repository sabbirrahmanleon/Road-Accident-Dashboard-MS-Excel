# Road-Accident-Dashboard-MS-Excel
This project involves creating a comprehensive Road Accident Dashboard using Microsoft Excel to analyze accident data from 2021 and 2022. The dashboard provides key insights into road safety by highlighting accident trends, casualty figures, vehicle impact, and environmental factors. Its purpose is to support stakeholders in making data-driven decisions to enhance road safety measures.

Objectives:
ðŸ“Œ Examine patterns in accident data to understand the contributing factors.
ðŸ“Œ Evaluate how variables such as vehicle type, road conditions, and lighting influence casualty rates.
ðŸ“Œ Develop an interactive dashboard that allows users to dynamically filter and explore the data.
ðŸ“Œ Provide actionable insights to help improve road safety strategies and policies.

Methodology:
âœ… Collected detailed accident records and performed data cleaning to ensure accuracy and consistency.
âœ… Utilized Pivot Tables and Pivot Charts to dissect the data, focusing on casualty counts, accident frequency, and vehicle involvement.
âœ… Implemented interactive slicers, buttons and filters to allow users to explore data across different dimensions.
âœ… Designed a user-friendly and visually compelling dashboard to highlight key metrics and facilitate quick decision-making.

Key Insights:
ðŸ“Œ Over 7,135 fatal casualties and 59,312 serious casualties recorded
ðŸ“Œ Cars account for the highest casualties (325,922), followed by bikes (33,672) and vans (33,472)
ðŸ“Œ Single carriageway roads (74%) see the highest accident rates
ðŸ“Œ Most accidents occur on dry roads (279,445 cases), but wet/damp roads also contribute significantly (114,697 cases)
ðŸ“Œ Surprisingly, better lighting does not translate to safer roads â€“ accidents peak in daylight, whereas lit roads during the dark also sees a high number of accidents
